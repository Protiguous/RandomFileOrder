# Random file order

Originaly from sourceforge user lumpiluk.
Added some funtionality and fixed some bugs.

## Description
If, like me, you have a car radio or a clock radio which cannot play tracks in random order from your usb stick itself, this application might be useful for you.
It randomly numbers every selected file in a specified folder. So all you've got to do when you want a new play order for your music tracks is run this application.
Also usefull for ordering numbers for a cd. Using [kid3](http://kid3.sourceforge.net/) you can then also easely add the track number in the tag info.
